# Hey, I'm Kate!

I am a sophomore at MIT pursuing a double major in Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science ([Course 6-14](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-14-computer-science-economics-and-data-science)) and in Mathematics ([Course 18](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/index.php)). I am passionate about using technology for social good, and I enjoy taking opportunities to learn and apply my skills to real-world problems.

I have experience in machine learning, software engineering, and research. I am dedicated to inspiring women in STEM and helping people receive a quality education. I have mentored classmates as a Python course assistant at MIT and taught algorithms and web development to high school girls in Mexico.

Aside from work, I am a saber fencer on the MIT Varsity Fencing Team, an Associate Advisor for incoming first-year students, and a sister of Pi Beta Phi.
